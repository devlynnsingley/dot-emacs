* vdiff

A tool like vimdiff for Emacs 

** Introduction

vdiff is a diff tool for Emacs that is made to behave like vimdiff, meaning diff
information is displayed in buffers as you edit them. There are commands for
cycling through the hunks detected by =diff= and applying changes from one
buffer to the other. The main features are

  1. Synchronized scrolling of the buffers with lines matching between the two
  2. Commands to transmit (send/receive) hunks between buffers
  3. Automatic folding of lines that are unchanged in both buffers
  4. Commands to jump easily between hunks
  5. Everything done through overlays, meaning vdiff doesn't alter the actual
     text in the buffer (unless you are transmit changes of course)
  6. Unlike ediff, remain in buffers instead of having to use a third "control
     buffer"
  7. Cool hydra (see below)

vdiff has not been extensively tested yet, so please report any issues you
find. Contributions and suggestions are very welcome.

** Recent (Significant) Changes
   - [2016-07-25] Added three-way diff support. See =vdiff-buffers3= and =vdiff-files3=.

** Installation and Usage
   
vdiff was recently added to MELPA, which is the recommended way to install it
and keep it up to date. To install it you may do =M-x package-install RET vdiff
RET=.
   
After installing you can bind the commands to your preferred key prefix like this

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'vdiff)
(define-key vdiff-mode-map (kbd "C-c") vdiff-mode-prefix-map)
#+END_SRC

which will bind most of the commands under the =C-c= prefix when vdiff-mode is
active. Of course you can pick whatever prefix you prefer. With the =C-c= prefix
the commands would be

*** Basics
    
| Key     | Command                 | Description                        |

| =C-c q= | =vdiff-quit=            | Quit vdiff                   |

Evil-mode users might prefer something like the following to use a comma as a
prefix in normal state.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'vdiff)
(require 'evil)
(evil-define-key 'normal vdiff-mode-map "," vdiff-mode-prefix-map)
#+END_SRC

To start vdiff, use either =vdiff-files= to select two files or =vdiff-buffers=
to select two open buffers.

** Hydra

Using the [[https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra][hydra package]], =vdiff-hydra= allows quick movement and changes to be
made in the buffer. By default it lives on the =h= command in the prefix
map. Bind =vdiff-hydra/body= directly to customize this key binding.

** Further customization
   
The current customization options and there defaults are
   
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; Whether to lock scrolling by default when starting vdiff
  (setq vdiff-lock-scrolling t)

  ;; external diff program/command to use
  (setq vdiff-diff-program "diff")

  ;; Extra arguments to pass to diff. If this is set wrong, you may
  ;; break vdiff.
  (setq vdiff-diff-program-args "")

  ;; Unchanged lines to leave unfolded around a fold
  (setq vdiff-fold-padding 6)

  ;; Minimum number of lines to fold
  (setq vdiff-min-fold-size 4)

  ;; If non-nil, avoid closing new folds around point.
  (setq vdiff-may-close-fold-on-point t)

  ;; Function that returns the string printed for a closed fold. The arguments
  ;; passed are the number of lines folded, the text on the first line, and the
  ;; width of the buffer.
  (setq vdiff-fold-string-function 'vdiff-fold-string-default)

  ;; Default syntax table class code to use for identifying \"words\" in
  ;; \`vdiff-refine-this-change'. Some useful options are
  ;; 
  ;; \"w\"   (default) words
  ;; \"w_\"  symbols \(really words plus symbol constituents\)
  ;; 
  ;; For more information see
  ;; https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Syntax-Class-Table.html
  (setq vdiff-default-refinement-syntax-code "w")

  ;; If non-nil, automatically refine all hunks.
  (setq vdiff-auto-refine nil)

  ;; How to represent subtractions (i.e., deleted lines). The
  ;; default is full which means add the same number of (fake) lines
  ;; as those that were removed. The choice single means add only one
  ;; fake line. The choice fringe means don't add lines but do
  ;; indicate the subtraction location in the fringe.
  (setq vdiff-subtraction-style 'full)

  ;; Character to use for filling subtraction lines. See also
  ;; `vdiff-subtraction-style'.
  (setq vdiff-subtraction-fill-char ?-)
