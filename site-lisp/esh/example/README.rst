==========================================
 A sample Emacs Syntax Highlighting setup
==========================================

Use ``make`` in this directory to build a syntax-highlighted copy of
``example.tex`` (`reference <example.reference.pdf>`_).  This assumes XeLaTeX;
if you are stuck with pdfLaTeX, use ``make pdflatex`` instead.

The first pages show a few built-in languages; the next few ones are more advanced
examples; most of them just require extra packages that you can install by
downloading `Cask <https://github.com/cask/cask>`_ before running ``make dep``;
the Coq one requires a local install of `Proof General <https://github.com/ProofGeneral/PG>`_.
