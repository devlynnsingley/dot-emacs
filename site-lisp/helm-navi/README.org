[[https://melpa.org/#/helm-navi][file:https://melpa.org/packages/helm-navi-badge.svg]]

This package lets you navigate through a buffer using the headings and keywords provided by [[https://github.com/tj64/navi][navi-mode]] and [[https://github.com/tj64/outshine][outshine]], presented in a Helm buffer.  Here's an example (note that fontification will be shown according to your own theme and faces):

** Installation

Install the package from MELPA and you're all set!

If you want to install it manually, put =helm-navi.el= in your =load-path=, then add this to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'helm-navi)
#+END_SRC

** Commands

+  =helm-navi=: Show all =navi-mode= keywords and =outshine= headings in a Helm buffer.  This is the equivalent of running =outshine-navi= and then pressing =C-8 a=.
+  =helm-navi-headings=: Show all =outshine= headings in Helm buffer.

** Tips

If you use =use-package= to organize your init file, you may want to add this to your config, which makes it very easy to quickly navigate to individual package configuration with =helm-navi=:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (use-package navi-mode
    :config
    ;; Add "use-package" lines to `navi-keywords'.
    (setf (cdr (assoc :ALL (cdr (assoc "emacs-lisp" navi-keywords))))
          "^[[:space:]]*(\\(use-package\\|\\(cl-\\)\\{0,1\\}def[a-z]+\\)\\*? "))
#+END_SRC
