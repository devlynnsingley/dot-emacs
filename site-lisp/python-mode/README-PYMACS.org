* Edit, debug, develop, run Python programs from Emacs.

 Code is also provided via melpa.org:

 (require 'package)
 
 (add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
             
 (package-initialize)

  M-x list-packages RET and select python-mode.el

* Pymacs  
  In case `Pymacs' was installed via `make' on your system, don't
  activate inlined one.  Keep `py-load-pymacs-p' nil.

  Otherwise setting `py-load-pymacs-p' to `t' should enable a
  company-based auto-completion - alongside with
  `py-company-pycomplete-p'.

  On systems which run Python3 as default
  setting
  export PYMACS_PYTHON=python2
  was reported being useful.
  Newer Pymacs should not need this.

* Troubleshooting
  When encountering a bug, maybe
  
  cd path/to/python-mode.el
  
  emacs -Q python-mode.el
  
  M-x eval-buffer RET
  
  and try again
