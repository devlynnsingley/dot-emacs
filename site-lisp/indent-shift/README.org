* indent-shift

  A more general implementation of the =python-indent-shift-left= and
  =python-indent-shift-right= commands. Basically just changes the
  indent width variable used to =tab-width= (from =python-indent-offset=).

** Installation

   Download ~shift-indent.el~ and use =package-install-file= to install
   it. Alternatively you could put it somewhere in your =load-path= and
   either add some autoloads manually or use =(require 'shift-indent)=.

** Usage

   Bind the commands to some keys and you're ready to go, for example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-<") 'indent-shift-left)
     (global-set-key (kbd "C->") 'indent-shift-right)
   #+END_SRC

   If you want to keep the original Python keybindings, you might not
   want to use these keys, or you could rebind them locally when
   =python-mode= starts.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                 (local-set-key (kbd "C->") 'python-indent-shift-right)
                 (local-set-key (kbd "C-<") 'python-indent-shift-left)))
   #+END_SRC
