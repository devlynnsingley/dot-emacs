# Thanks for helping out!

Reporting an error?  Oh no!  I'm happy to take a look at it, but *please* provide the backtrace in your issue: before triggering the error make sure `debug-on-error` is set to `t` (interactively, you can use `M-x toggle-debug-on-error`).  Then, just copy the backtrace that's provided :smile:

# Feature Requests

Always welcome!  Please be specific about what you want, though.  A little bit of code can go a long way :wink:  (and a pull request goes even further!)
